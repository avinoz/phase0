# The Condensed Road Map Reference Guide

Congrats & Welcome! I compiled this guide because I'm pretty OCD and hate read vast amount of text to extract what I need. I also have a love for checklists but I suppose that goes with my OCDness.

As to not confuse anyone, this is my version of the cirriculum handbook. Please refer to DBC's handbook for more details and the most up-to-date information. I hope this will help you get on your feet fast because Phase One will fly by sooner than you can blink  :)
